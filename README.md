# automation-test-challenge

## Technologies Used: 
1.	Programming Language : Javascript
2.	Build Tool : npm
3.	Automation Tool used : cypress.io

## Installation
After cloning the project from the repository, make sure you run `npm install` to install all node modules. There should be no further installation required.

## Command to run Test
`npm run test:prod` is the command to run the test

## Project Structure :

1.	Fixtures : Fixtures are used as test-data that can be used by test-scripts.  Fixture files are in cypress/fixtures folder. 
2.	support :    Support files are in cypress/support.

    - cypress/support/index.js.  This file runs before every single spec file. We have imported all the .js file inside the support folder in the index.js, so we donâ€™t have to import in all the test-scripts.
Cypress executes the support file before the spec file.

3. Plugins Folder : The plugins file is a special file that executes in Node before the project is loaded, before the browser launches, and during your test execution

4. Integration folder: This folder contains all the test-scripts.
